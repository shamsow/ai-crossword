# AI Crossword

Given a text(.txt) file of words(where each word is on a seperate line), and a structure(refer to data folder),
this AI will pick words to fit the structure and generate the crossword.

An image of the generated crossword can also be created by supplying the optional `[output]` argument, which is the desired name of the image file.

The structure featured in data/structure3.txt is currently the most complex structure this AI can handle at a reasonable amount of time.

Run `python3 generate.py structure words [output]` to generate.
