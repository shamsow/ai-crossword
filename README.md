# AI Crossword

Given a text(.txt) file of words(where each word is on a seperate line), and a structure(refer to data folder),
this AI will pick words to fit the structure and generate the crossword.

The structure featured in data/structure3.txt is currently the most complex structure this AI can handle at a reasonable amount of time.

Run `python3 generate.py structure words [output]` to generate.
